                    <p id="careerdesc">I am currently employed by nexAir, which is a local company in Memphis.
                        nexAir is an industrial gas and welding supply company which was founded in 1940. We have
                        around 70 locations ranging between plants to retail stores to distribution centers. I have
                        been with the company for three years and have enjoyed the investment I have made. My
                        specific role is Systems Administrator and Support Lead for nexAir's Information Technology
                        Department. I am the primary Administrator of our instance of Microsoft Endpoint Manager and
                        I assist in managing various resources in our Azure enviornment. From the Support side, I
                        lead our HelpDesk to assist in
                        troubleshooting issues and escalations. The last few months I have been working on a small
                        team to integrate a data warehouse solution using Azure Synapse. One of my best
                        accomplishments is building a Windows Presentation Foundation application which runs on all
                        of our retail counters. This application works as a utility shell for various retail uses,
                        such as our ERP system. On my personal time, I am working to master Python, SQL, JavaScript,
                        and C# as I feel those are four fundamental languages which will pave the way for years to
                        come. I would love to become a Cloud Developer, but my aspiration is to eventually work with
                        Artificial Intelligence and specifically focus on reducing AI predicability.</p>
