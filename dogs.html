                <td class="dogdesc">Xena is a beautiful white dog with bright eyes and a playful personality.
                    She was named by my nephew Jace, who had never even heard of Xena, The Warrior Princess,
                    but the name seemed to fit her perfectly. She is strong and brave, and has proven herself to be
                    a loyal and loving companion to me. When Xena was just three months old, she was originally
                    supposed
                    to be my nephew's dog. But due to circumstances at the time, I ended up taking her in as my own.
                    It was
                    a decision I would never regret, as Xena quickly became a beloved companion. Xena had an
                    opportunity once
                    to display her bravery and strength. When she was just four years old. She had chased after a
                    squirrel
                    and unfortunately was hit by a speeding truck. She fled into the woods, and for three days I was
                    convinced the worst had happened. But then, my mom called to tell me that an older gentleman had
                    found Xena
                    the day before and had been taking care of her. We rushed to pick her up, and when we arrived,
                    we saw that she
                    had a hole in her chin that needed to be stitched up by the vet. But within weeks, Xena was back
                    to
                    her old self, full of energy and ready to play. It is clear to me that Xena has a special
                    strength and resilience
                    that allows her to overcome any obstacle. She is a true warrior, and I am grateful to have her
                    by my side.</td>

                    energy that never seems to waver. She iss a Belgian Malinois mix, with sleek black/brown fur and
                    piercing brown eyes that seemed to take in everything around her. Bellatrix loves nothing more
                    than to run and playk, chasing after balls and Frisbees. She iss always the first one to jump
                    into action when someone suggests a game,
                    and her enthusiasm is contagious.
                    But even when she isn't playing, Bellatrix is always happy and full of life. She is a loyal
                    companion, and loves nothing more than to curl up next to her human friends and be showered with
                    affection.
                    Despite her playful nature, Bellatrix is also highly intelligent and could be trained to do
                    just about anything. She excels agility, and seems to thrive on the
                    challenge of learning new things. Overall, Bellatrix iss a joy to be around, and her zest for
                    life is infectious. She iss a
                    beloved member of the family, and has brought joy and laughter to everyone she met.</td>
