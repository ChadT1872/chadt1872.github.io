            As you probably know by now, my name is Chad Thweatt. I am currently 32 years old and work as a Systems
            Administrator at nexAir in Memphis, TN. I was born and raised in Memphis and went to high school at Southern
            Baptist Educational Center. I am an avid sports fan, specifically am a huge fan of the Memphis Grizzlies and
            Philadelphia Eagles. One of my favorite hobbies outside of programming related projects is to play guitar.
            The acoustic sound is what I prefer, so you can find me playing on my Takamine at least 30 minutes to an
            hour a day. I have written songs, but I am not brave enought to reveal them to anyone... yet. My typical
            weekend is spent walking/playing with my two dogs, Bellatrix and Xena, working on various projects (both
            programming and non-programming related), watching/analyzing sports, reading a good book, and spending time
            with my girlfriend, Breanna. I love playing computer games, but I don't have as much time to play nowadays.
            When I do have the time, I love to play Destiny 2, Rocket League, & horror games.</h3>
